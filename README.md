## Description

Local Stores tracks the availability of different brands at different shoe stores. Each brand is sold at many stores, and each store carries many brands. Thus, there is a many-to-many relationship between brands and stores.

Local Stores demonstrates using Spark routes to perform CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database. It also demonstrates the use of a join table and JOIN statements to manage a many-to-many relationship.
