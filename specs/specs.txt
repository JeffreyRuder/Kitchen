Build full CRUD functionality for Stores. Create, Read (show all, show single), Update, Delete.

Allow a user to create Brands that are assigned to a Store. Don't worry about building out updating or deleting for brands.

There is a many-to-many relationship between brands and shoe stores, so many shoe stores can carry many brands and a brand of shoes can be carried in many stores. Create a join table to store these relationships.

When a user is viewing a single store, list out all of the brands that have been added so far to that store and allow them to add a brand to that store. Create a method to get the brands sold at a store, and use a join statement in it.

When a user is viewing a single Brand, list out all of the Stores that carry that brand and allow them to add a Store to that Brand. Use a join statement in this method too.
